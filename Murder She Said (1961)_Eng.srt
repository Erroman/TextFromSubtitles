1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,835
Station annouuncer: The train standing
at Platform 2 is the 4:50

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,755
for Ealing Broadway. Hanwell.
Hayes. West Drayton.

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,198
Langley. Taplow. Milchester
and Brackhampton.

4
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,070
- Tickets, please.
- A woman has been strangled.

5
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,198
- Pardon?
- A man strangled a woman in a train.

6
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,794
- I saw it out there!
- Strangled?

7
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,514
Yes, strangled.
You must do something.

8
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,709
Me? Well...

9
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,988
Madam, don't you think you had a nap
and maybe had a bad dream?

10
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,671
Young man, I was not dreaming.
What are you going to do about it?

11
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,759
Well... we'll be in Brackhampton
in about five minutes.

12
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,036
- I'll report it then.
- Thank you.

13
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,395
- Can I have your details?
- Of course.

14
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,432
Miss Jane Marple.

15
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,999
- Marple?
- Marple.

16
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,159
Old Pasture Lane.

17
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,994
- Milchester.
- Milchester. I see.

18
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,355
I'll report it
to the stationmaster...

19
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,279
- Yes, please do.
- Thank you.

20
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,951
A bad dream indeed.

21
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,671
All right, Lucy, I'll answer that.

22
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,832
- Good morning...
- Not today.

23
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,358
Inspector Craddock, County CID.

24
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,074
Oh, I am so sorry.
Do come in, Inspector.

25
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,036
I've been going through
all the papers for the last two days

26
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,952
and not a word about the murder.

27
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,036
I suppose the police asked the press
to say nothing for now.

28
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,519
Do sit down.

29
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,869
Lull the murderer into a false sense
of security, then pounce!

30
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,359
What's that?

31
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,671
Oh, how stupid of me. I am so sorry.

32
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,115
Lucy!
You will have some tea, won't you?

33
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,714
- Oh...
- Tea for the Inspector, please.

34
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,869
Yes, ma'am.

35
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,758
Well now, have you got him?

36
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,316
Well, I... that is...

37
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,995
...we've come to the conclusion that
what you saw on the train was...

38
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,435
...a man and a woman...

39
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,589
Yes, as I said.

40
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,356
I mean...
perhaps they were honeymooners?

41
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,952
Inspector, I may be
what is termed a spinster,

42
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,908
but I do know the difference
between horseplay and murder.

43
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,872
Yes, Miss Marple, but there's been
a full search of every train

44
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,395
and no hospital has treated
any such woman.

45
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,755
She was blonde,
with a fur collar coat.

46
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,953
No such woman was seen getting on or
off a train alone or accompanied.

47
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,912
Of course not, she was dead!

48
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,796
The tracks were searched for the
whole length of the line - negative.

49
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,517
Oh, so you don't believe me?

50
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,229
I didn't mean to imply that.

51
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,958
- You did.
- Not at all.

52
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,593
What then?

53
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,198
A woman cannot be murdered
on a busy train

54
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,271
without our finding out about it.

55
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,475
I'm sure you mean well, Inspector,

56
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,995
but if you imagine
that I am going to sit back

57
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,311
and let everybody regard me
as a dotty old maid,

58
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,038
you are very much mistaken.

59
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,034
Good day!

60
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,274
I'm sorry, The Hatrack Hanging,
Falcon Smith's latest,

61
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,034
we haven't received our copy yet.

62
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,428
Plain inefficiency.

63
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,670
- Let me know the moment it comes in.
- Of course, Mrs Stainton.

64
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,196
- Good morning, Miss Marple.
- Good morning, Mr Stringer.

65
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,588
Good morning, Hilda.

66
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,594
One moment...

67
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,358
...The Hatrack Hanging,
I've been keeping it for you.

68
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,474
- Would you say I am unstable?
- Certainly not.

69
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,996
- In full possession of my faculties?
- Absolutely...

70
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,390
- Not given to hallucinations?
- No.

71
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,511
Thank you, Mr Stringer.

72
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,750
- The police think I'm dotty.
- What?

73
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,229
Apparently,
I saw a young man and woman

74
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,277
in the throes of connubial bliss.

75
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,234
If I were you, Miss Marple,
I would write to the Chief Constable.

76
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,029
Mr Stringer, how many detective
novels have we read over the years?

77
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,754
Lmpossible to say.
Certainly hundreds.

78
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,078
Yes, which gives us a certain
knowledge of the criminal mind?

79
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,434
Most assuredly.

80
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,513
Well, this is where we put
that knowledge to the test.

81
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,398
- We?
- Yes, we!

82
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,275
So it has come in!

83
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,519
Oh, has it?

84
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,875
Well, I think I have first call.

85
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,476
You won't like it. Too obvious.
The mother did it, of course.

86
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,596
How do you know? It's just come in.

87
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,594
It always is with Falcon Smith.
A deprived child, you know.

88
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,312
Crumpets for tea,
Mr Stringer, if you care to join me.

89
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,590
Indeed I would, Miss Marple.

90
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,033
Ah, yes, here we are.

91
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,277
I calculate the five o'clock express
to Brackhampton overtook my train

92
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,078
somewhere about there.

93
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,072
How can you be sure?

94
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,676
The ticket collector said
five minutes to Brackhampton.

95
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,718
He came in more than a minute
after the murder.

96
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,079
So that makes it six minutes before
Brackhampton at, say, 30 mph.

97
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,673
So... about there!

98
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,198
The body, Miss Marple?

99
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,478
That was thrown from the train
between here and Brackhampton.

100
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,279
- The police found nothing.
- Of course not.

101
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,115
The murderer returned before the
search and disposed of the body.

102
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,477
By Jove, the police will want
to investigate now.

103
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,029
They say there is no investigation.

104
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,115
- Surely, a fresh search...
- Yes, but we will conduct our own.

105
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,311
- Eh?
- Yes, Mr Stringer.

106
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,318
I recommend
a hearty breakfast tomorrow.

107
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,358
You and I are going to take
an early morning walk!

108
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,316
There must be something somewhere.

109
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,837
A body can't be thrown out of a
fast-moving train without some trace.

110
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,834
If we linger here much longer,
we shall certainly be apprehended.

111
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,470
Nonsense! No one will give two
tracklayers a second glance.

112
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,438
I'm not convinced
our disguises are adequate.

113
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,478
A shoe, a bit of cloth... something.

114
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,108
Our timetable
may have been out of date,

115
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,669
but I'm sure
the 7:15 is still running.

116
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,435
- Very possibly.
- It could be most dangerous up here.

117
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,589
Undoubtedly.

118
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,719
Miss Marple!

119
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,558
- Miss Marple!
- Yes?

120
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,352
There you are!
I think I heard something.

121
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,397
I think I've found something.

122
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,794
Really?

123
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,949
Consistent with something
having been dumped from a train.

124
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,151
If it was the body,

125
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,915
it would roll down and finish up
against this wall.

126
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,519
Then where is it?

127
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,669
That, Mr Stringer, is the question.

128
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,435
It could be buried.

129
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,238
You'd need a pick or a shovel.

130
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,191
No, this is hardly an ideal spot
for disposing of a body.

131
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,874
Unless...

132
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,831
From her fur collar, I think.

133
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,908
Mr Stringer,
will you give me a leg up?

134
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,038
- Really, Miss Marple, I...
- Please, Mr Stringer.

135
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,079
No, no!

136
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,629
Make a stirrup.

137
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,159
That's it. Come on now.
CarefuI! Are you ready?

138
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,432
- Interlock your fingers!
- They are interlocked!

139
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,309
- Well, are you ready?
- Yes... up!

140
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,429
Magnificent!

141
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,674
Down!

142
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,113
- What a frightfuI man.
- What a frightfuI dog!

143
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,714
Miss Marple,
prudence demands a retreat.

144
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,190
I am convinced the body
is on the other side of this wall.

145
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,789
That's the Ackenthorpe Hall Estate?

146
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,552
I know. Perfect.

147
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,797
Easy enough for someone
from the house to get the body

148
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,871
and dispose of it in the grounds.

149
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,712
Do you mean one of the family?

150
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,792
Yes, or one of the servants -
if they have any.

151
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,197
Servants... I wonder...

152
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,432
Miss Marple, whatever it is,
no, no, no!

153
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,474
Mr Stringer,
we will withdraw temporarily.

154
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,516
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

155
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,156
There's nothing on my books.
Not so much as a mother's help.

156
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,794
I'm seeking a post, not offering one.

157
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,315
Pray be seated, my good woman.

158
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,040
Seek no more.
You've come to the right place.

159
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,476
How good to see the spirit
of unselfish service is still here.

160
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,518
Let me see now.

161
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,352
Yes! Here's a perfect plum.

162
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,836
"CheerfuI home for cheerfuI lady.

163
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,231
Own suite, TV, radio
and a use of car.

164
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,834
Tea in bed on Sundays.
Pension scheme."

165
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,950
Heaven forbid!

166
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,873
Oh, all right.

167
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,510
"Mrs Forbes Alexbridge.
Setting up house near Monte Carlo."

168
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,877
They won't have foreigners.
"Own gaming allowance."

169
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,559
I don't like gambling.

170
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,796
"Mrs Hamilton Potts."
The Dingley Stud Farm, you know.

171
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,394
"Seven children - eldest seven."

172
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,788
Oh, no, thank you.

173
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,833
May I have a quiet word
with Mrs Binster?

174
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,433
I am Mrs Binster.

175
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,039
Oh, I see.

176
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,708
Well, I wondered if there was
a position at Ackenthorpe Hall?

177
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,071
- Ackenthorpe Hall?
- Yes, Ackenthorpe Hall.

178
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,677
Oh, yes,
I think I can accommodate you.

179
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,960
Yes, there's always a vacancy there.

180
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,514
Thank you.

181
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,429
Yes?

182
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,518
I'm Jane, from Mrs Binster's
Employment Agency, the new maid.

183
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,112
Well, you look old enough
to know better. Come in.

184
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,555
- I am to see Miss Ackenthorpe.
- You're expected. In there.

185
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,234
- Miss Ackenthorpe?
- Yes.

186
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,793
I'm Jane.

187
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,551
- The new maid?
- Yes, Jane Marple.

188
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,553
If you'll kindly show me
where to put my things...

189
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,876
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

190
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,238
Is this post
really what you are looking for?

191
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,633
Well naturally,
otherwise I wouldn't be here.

192
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,637
I don't want a housekeeper.

193
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,030
I want someone to... to do the work.

194
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,233
Yes. You want cooking, washing up,
beds made, floors scrubbed,

195
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,113
fires lit, ashes taken away...
I understand.

196
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,476
- I hope you'll find us suitable.
- Oh, I'm sure I shall.

197
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,956
I hope the work's not too exacting.
There are three of us,

198
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,237
myself, my nephew -
down for the school holidays -

199
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,479
and Father.

200
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,756
- May I show you to your room?
- Yes.

201
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,679
I'll take that, my dear.
Perhaps the clubs, if you don't mind.

202
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,150
- I must keep fit, you know.
- Yes, of course.

203
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,394
Our staff consists of Hillman,
the gardener,

204
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,357
and Mrs Kidder, she let you in.

205
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,671
She comes in three afternoons a week
to do the rough work.

206
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,795
My grandfather. He founded
the family fortune - tea biscuits.

207
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,675
Oh yes and very excellent biscuits
they were too.

208
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,079
A severe man, I'm afraid.

209
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,950
Miss Marple, I think it only fair
to explain that my father is...

210
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,390
...quite frankly, difficult at times.

211
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,834
He's an invalid.

212
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,391
He's very keen on economy

213
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,028
and sometimes says things
that upset people.

214
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,079
- I wouldn't want you to...
- I'm used to caring for the elderly.

215
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,159
We'll manage.

216
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,634
Emma!

217
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,234
Emma! I hear you!

218
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,392
- Yes, Father. Excuse me.
- Don't try to sneak off.

219
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,594
- Is the new girl with you?
- Well... yes, Father.

220
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,994
I hope she's got more meat on her
than the last one. I hate 'em skinny!

221
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,752
Don't just stand there boggling,
bring her in.

222
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,428
Yes... er...
will you come in please?

223
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,074
Father,
this is Miss Marple, er... Jane.

224
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,237
A plain Jane if I ever saw one.

225
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,115
We can't all be young and handsome
can we, Mr Ackenthorpe?

226
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,834
I cannot tolerate impertinence.

227
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,473
Then we should get on admirably -
neither can I.

228
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,314
If you're staying and I suppose
you've got to, understand this:

229
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,274
Because I live in a big house
doesn't mean I'm a rich man.

230
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,795
So don't come here
with big ideas.

231
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,071
I live here because I want to,
not because I can afford it.

232
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,553
- Father, don't you think...
- No! Can you cook?

233
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,399
If you want
good English cooking, yes.

234
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,319
Cod is as good as lobster
and much cheaper.

235
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,391
That depends on whether one has
a palate unsullied by cheap opiates.

236
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,990
If you mean what I think you mean,
this cost two shillings.

237
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,519
Yes, quite.

238
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,429
- I'll show Miss Marple to her room.
- Good idea.

239
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,518
That was Hillman the gardener. When
Father moves about, he calls him.

240
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,795
They're close.

241
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,995
Will you stay, Miss Marple... Jane?

242
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,877
- My dear lady, of course.
- I'm so glad.

243
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,592
Emma, come back here!
You've forgotten my medicine.

244
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,954
Excuse me.

245
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,759
Your room is the door
opposite the small stairs.

246
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,150
- I'll find it.
- May I give you those?

247
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,072
- All right?
- Yes, thank you.

248
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,839
Come out, at once!

249
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,278
I advise you to come out!

250
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,314
Very well...

251
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,431
You're Miss Emma's nephew, I presume?

252
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,478
Yes, Alexander Eastley.
How do you do?

253
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,871
How do you do?
I'm Jane. Jane Marple.

254
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,197
Yes... it is disappointing, isn't it?

255
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,191
I'd hoped for a Jayne Mansfield.

256
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,833
You have much in common
with your grandfather.

257
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,718
We're very alike in many ways.

258
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,799
Mind you, I'm not mean. He'll stop
that vase out of your wages.

259
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,319
It's just as well
you got out of the way, or...

260
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,119
It would have been my head
and you would get 10 years.

261
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,308
It's still possible.

262
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,399
Not only do you
not look like Jayne Mansfield,

263
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,437
you're not my idea of a maid either.

264
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,918
Well, quite honestly, I don't think
you'd be everybody's idea of a boy.

265
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,509
There's something
very fishy about you.

266
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,711
I can see you'll have to go -

267
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,549
after Mrs Kidder of course,
she's next, depressing creature.

268
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,551
- So was Annie.
- Annie?

269
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,311
Your predecessor. Thin as a rake
and a shocking cook. Can you cook?

270
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,596
I think I've done better than Annie.

271
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,476
Grandfather's like that too
and he hates a late dinner.

272
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,756
I'd leave the unpacking
if I were you.

273
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,595
In that case, you'd better
show me to the kitchen, Alexander.

274
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,512
Very well... Jane.

275
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,789
Emma!

276
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,555
That's him - always shouting,
mostly about money. This way.

277
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,709
Emma!

278
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,434
They're all waiting
for him to drop dead.

279
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,388
FrightfuI pack of vultures our
family, except possibly Aunt Emma.

280
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,198
Who are these vultures?

281
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,352
Uncle Harold -
stinking rich and just as mean.

282
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,875
Uncle Albert -
deadly dull, poor fellow.

283
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,589
Then there's Uncle Cedric.
He paints, but not for art's sake.

284
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,228
Last year,
he and one of his models...

285
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,111
- Alexander!
- He's like that.

286
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,118
- There was an Uncle Edmond.
- Was?

287
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,477
Yes, stopped a whole bomb
during the war all by himself.

288
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,916
There wasn't another man around
for miles - deserting probably.

289
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,190
Who can be held responsible for you?

290
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,870
Well put. Mummy's name was Edith,
but she's dead.

291
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,469
- Daddy is Brian Eastley.
- Oh?

292
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,756
The fighter ace - Battle of Britain.

293
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,150
- Oh, THE Brian Eastley.
- Yes.

294
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,155
I'll set him up in business when
I get my inheritance. Here we are.

295
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,631
There you are. About time. I'm off.

296
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,190
I wouldn't stay here after dark,
not for all the tea in China.

297
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,870
The pots and pans are
on that shelf there over the stove.

298
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,550
The groceries
and provisions are in there.

299
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,356
- Thank you.
- Cheerio.

300
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,158
- Good day.
- Good day.

301
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,394
- What's the matter?
- I was being polite.

302
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,351
Charming, isn't she, Jane?

303
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,397
- You should see this.
- What?

304
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,596
Phase four: Anti-Kidder campaign.

305
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,119
Splendid!

306
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,512
Dinner at eight please, Jane.

307
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,311
I see you made yourself comfortable.

308
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,436
I trust you have no objection?

309
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,749
Maybe.

310
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,277
I shouldn't make yourself
too comfortable if I was you.

311
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,989
Yes?

312
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,949
Oh, who are you?

313
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,637
I'm the new maid, sir.

314
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,513
Dr Quimper.
You'll get used to seeing me here.

315
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,153
- Alexander, I suppose.
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

316
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,595
Mr Ackenthorpe will be expecting me.

317
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,955
- I'll show you up.
- That won't be...

318
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,549
Doctor...

319
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,674
Where on earth
are my confounded matches?

320
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,478
- It's you.
- Good morning.

321
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,629
Morning.

322
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,553
What are you doing in here?
Snooping, I suppose?

323
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,233
Where are my matches?

324
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,959
If you're going to smoke,
I'll open a window.

325
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,271
I'm a great believer in fresh air.
Aren't you, Doctor?

326
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,635
Why, yes, I am... Miss...

327
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,031
Marple her name, marble her nature!

328
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,554
Let her give me double pneumonia!

329
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,910
If you can't kill me off one way,
you'll kill me off another.

330
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,550
You're going to live to be 100
in spite of anything I can do.

331
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,269
Then tell her to stop opening windows
and light my cheroot.

332
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,313
Any chance
that will send him to sleep, Doctor?

333
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,715
I'm afraid it's a stimulant.

334
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,834
- Roll over.
- Oh, dear.

335
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,791
Hold it closer, woman!

336
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,877
Your home town lost
a good horse doctor when you left.

337
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,156
In fact, I was bad with horses.

338
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,437
How did the birthday party go?
Did all the family get down?

339
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,955
Of course they did -
made a weekend of it,

340
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,111
free board and lodging
from Friday night.

341
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,669
- Friday.
- What's that to do with you?

342
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,476
Oh, nothing! It just happened to be
an interesting day for me too.

343
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,073
How old were you?

344
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,909
Mind your business.
Anyhow, it was a miserable weekend.

345
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,749
I hope it'll be a long time before
I have to put up with them again.

346
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,200
Not a nice way
to talk about one's family.

347
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,638
Not a nice family. You know what
that overgrown beatnik Cedric did?

348
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,509
He told Emma in front of me
she should get away and get married.

349
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,671
Trying to make her
as selfish as he is.

350
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,515
I don't know. If Emma did marry,
it wouldn't be such a bad thing.

351
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,550
Father, I thought I'd tell you,
I'm just going into town.

352
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,631
I'm leaving. Can I give you a lift?

353
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,837
Why do you want to go to town?
Can't she go for you?

354
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,070
It's tradesmen. A few bills to pay.

355
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,435
Oh, money, that's a different thing.

356
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,160
You can't trust anybody
these days. Off you go.

357
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,316
- May I be of service?
- Thank you.

358
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,155
Of course you can, save the price
of a taxi. I pay you enough as it is.

359
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,311
It will be on your bill.
Are you ready?

360
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,754
- Only my coat.
- Good.

361
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,275
Friday then, Mr Ackenthorpe.
Good day, Miss Marple.

362
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,198
Good day, Doctor.

363
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,193
If you don't
shut those windows, you'll be fired!

364
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,551
In that case, I shall require
four weeks wages in lieu of notice.

365
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,439
- Get out of my sight, woman!
- With pleasure!

366
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,868
Your weight isn't evenly distributed.

367
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,069
I'll have you know that I won
the Ladies Open Handicap in 1921.

368
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,676
- Really?
- You must have many things to do.

369
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,589
Not at all, I'm most interested.
We've never had a golf-playing maid.

370
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,955
This is the age of the common woman.

371
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,276
- You hooked.
- I'm aware of it.

372
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,111
- You know something?
- What?

373
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,198
I believe
you pulled those shots on purpose.

374
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,551
Alexander,
if you wish to be helpfuI at all,

375
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,554
will you kindly look for the hook
while I look for the slice.

376
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,112
- Found yours yet?
- Yes, have you?

377
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,829
- Disappeared without a trace.
- Fortunately I have some more.

378
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,673
At the present rate,
you're going to need them.

379
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,434
Perhaps you could
demonstrate the next one.

380
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,589
Certainly.

381
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,671
Let's see how close
you can get to those outbuildings.

382
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,269
Yes, I think that's possible.

383
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,949
Fair.

384
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,796
You know perfectly well
it was superb for a boy of my age.

385
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,789
A chip and a putt
and I'd have holed out in three.

386
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,433
Does you grandfather
keep horses, Alexander?

387
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,070
He did. Now he just keeps relics
of a more spacious age.

388
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,994
Nostalgia, you know - a failing
of the old, I suppose. Like to look?

389
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,115
Well, I think
I'm old enough, don't you?

390
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,037
An old-fashioned pony chaise.

391
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,191
It was used for going to the village.

392
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,555
And the Victoria
for going to church?

393
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,995
Yes, on Sundays
in the summer I believe.

394
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,235
The brougham is
for the winter perhaps?

395
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,992
Yes, I expect so.

396
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,199
It's haunted here. Grandfather found
a man hanging from this rafter.

397
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,510
- Oh!
- He'd been dead for a week.

398
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,796
- All purple, you know.
- Alexander!

399
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,511
- What was that?
- I wonder.

400
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,478
- All right, I'll look.
- All yours.

401
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,515
Dear, dear.
We are nervous, aren't we?

402
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,160
- Pity.
- What did you expect to find?

403
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,958
- Bodies.
- What?

404
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,439
Live ones, of course.

405
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,239
Used to be quite a spot
for courting couples

406
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,392
till Grandfather got
Hillman to put a stop to it.

407
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,915
Quite extraordinary
the goings-on here.

408
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,719
- Apparently, this girl...
- That's enough.

409
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,314
There may be
some other poor bird trapped.

410
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,758
Look. Somebody else must have been
in here. This isn't Aunt Emma's.

411
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,480
It's mine. I must have dropped it.

412
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,189
Thank you so much.
It was bequeathed to me.

413
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,311
Are you on the run from the police?

414
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,479
Too much television. You must learn
to rationalize your imagination.

415
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,517
What's behind there?
More relics from the past?

416
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,190
Yes. The fruits
of Grandfather's Egyptian phase.

417
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,549
Indeed.

418
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,919
How interesting.

419
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,751
- No one's allowed in there.
- Let go!

420
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,319
What are you up to?

421
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,835
- The boy was showing me round.
- What boy?

422
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,752
- Alexander!
- You're lying.

423
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,230
Alexander, come out of there at once.

424
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,753
I thought discretion
the better part of valour.

425
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,229
He's not above
clipping a person's ear.

426
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,916
Your grandfather don't like snoopers.
Don't think I won't tell him neither.

427
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,675
Despite the double negatives,
I'm sure you will. Come, Jane.

428
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,319
Good for you, young man.

429
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,072
What?

430
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,959
No! No!

431
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,390
Now listen, Mr Stringer,

432
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,393
I want you
to inform the police anonymously.

433
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,357
Don't mention me yet,

434
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,590
I wish to be
in at the kill so to speak.

435
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,119
Miss Marple, really!

436
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,512
All right, but it makes my blood
run cold to think of you there alone.

437
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,070
I was wondering perhaps
they have a vacancy for a gardener?

438
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,879
They've got one.

439
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,917
Very well, I'll do as you say.

440
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,076
The compact! If the murderer
should know that you have it...

441
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,714
I'll be carefuI, dear Mr Stringer.

442
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,916
Now, phone the Inspector right away.

443
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,718
- Well?
- I've never seen her before.

444
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,836
No, she's not from these parts.

445
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,639
Whoever she is,
I want her out of here at once.

446
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,916
If you hadn't left the barn unlocked,

447
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,117
we wouldn't have
these people poking their noses in.

448
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,192
- Are you all right, Father?
- Of course I'm all right.

449
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,636
I have seen a corpse before.
I'll be one myself soon.

450
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,269
Perhaps you'd better go back
to the house. I'll follow you up.

451
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,960
Whoever it was
tried to get her in here first.

452
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,317
It must have taken
the strength of a maniac to shift it.

453
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,439
- Inspector?
- Yes, Doctor?

454
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,511
I don't know if this is helpfuI.

455
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,310
- Go on.
- Well, the woman...

456
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,359
No one recognised her and her
clothes struck me as being foreign.

457
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,351
Perhaps French.

458
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,352
Yes, that's very interesting.
Thank you, Doctor.

459
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,710
Well, it was just a thought.

460
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,717
It may be a usefuI one. Thank you.

461
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,439
That explains why I didn't recognise
her. I know every face around here.

462
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,919
I'm sure you do.

463
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,198
I have to assume there's a connection
between her and the family.

464
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,113
I think
I'll get the whole bunch down here.

465
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,589
They hate the sight of each other.

466
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,877
So I believe. Anyway, routine first.

467
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,508
Have they got any other servants?

468
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,398
Yes, they have, Inspector.

469
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,515
Good Lord! You!

470
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,119
Yes.

471
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,793
Dotty old me.

472
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,113
In there please.

473
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,115
It's only a cigarette packet -
of doubtfuI significance, I'd say.

474
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,991
I'll bear your views in mind.

475
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,799
Any idea
what you expect your fellows to find?

476
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,392
- Clues.
- Well, naturally.

477
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,233
Do you seriously
think they'll find anything?

478
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,956
Well, somebody dragged the body
from there over to there.

479
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,954
Something could have been dropped
in the process, don't you agree?

480
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,112
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- Did you find anything?

481
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,236
No, Inspector. Not a thing.

482
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,392
- The family is here by the way.
- Thank you.

483
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,232
I'll get around to them later.

484
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,868
They'll enjoy that, I'm sure.
Good hunting.

485
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,234
Some idiot strangles his girlfriend,
which she probably deserved

486
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,913
and what do they do -

487
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,516
swarm all over the place and
mess about in our private affairs.

488
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,638
I said to Inspector Haddock
or whatever his name is...

489
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,236
Craddock, sir. Shall I pour?

490
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,628
Of course.

491
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,754
Anyway,
I said to this fellow, Haddock,

492
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,196
that no member of my family
had ever seen the woman before.

493
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,756
- What makes you so sure of that?
- Cedric, this is absurd.

494
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,475
She wasn't from around here
and she was found in our stable.

495
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,398
One of us could have known her.

496
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,512
- Maybe she was your girlfriend.
- What?

497
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,598
Yes, yes,
I suppose Cedric has a point there.

498
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,156
- He never has a point.
- I mean from the police's viewpoint.

499
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,074
You're not too concerned
with the family reputation.

500
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,312
You're not a member of it,
are you, strictly speaking?

501
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,750
Who telephoned the police?

502
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,439
Oh, I know who did that!

503
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,952
Oh, who?

504
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,879
Obviously someone
who knew the body was there.

505
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,231
Any coffee left, Jane?

506
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,392
Help yourself.

507
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,512
- It certainly wasn't one of us.
- Who knows?

508
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,712
Who cares who did it?
The woman was probably a spy.

509
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,196
- That's absurd.
- The police think she was foreign.

510
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,278
Lots of English girls
go to Paris and buy clothes.

511
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,553
Decent ones don't.

512
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,393
Dr Quimper to see you,
Mr Ackenthorpe.

513
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,677
Still getting shot
with revitalizers, Father?

514
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,308
I'll take anything to outlive you lot

515
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,153
and keep my property
from your thieving hands.

516
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,475
I'll go and see if I can be of
any further assistance to the police.

517
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,437
Delicious coffee, Jane.

518
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,431
The Inspector said
he'd be interrogating you all later.

519
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,591
Better get your alibis ready.

520
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,277
He's a bright boy, that one.

521
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,873
The police say
the woman was murdered on Friday

522
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,031
and we were down here last Friday.

523
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,077
They will be interested in all of us.

524
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,196
None of us were here till quite late.

525
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,469
Yes, but the point is,
what were we all doing earlier?

526
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,995
- Albert, what about you?
- Me?

527
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,594
Don't tell me
you were in your office.

528
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,638
- I... well, no.
- Aha!

529
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,110
As a matter of fact, there was
a film that I went to see.

530
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,829
- A Brigitte Bardot?
- Cedric, this is preposterous.

531
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,271
Well, is it, Harold? What about you?

532
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,796
Or can your secretary verify
your movements on that day?

533
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,520
- None of your business.
- I'm in the clear.

534
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,713
- I was at my club.
- It has a back door, hasn't it?

535
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,952
Yes, I think so,
but I didn't get here until Saturday.

536
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,588
You could have lugged the body
up here on Friday, slipped back

537
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,911
and be sitting in your
usual chair when the club closed.

538
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,554
Can one of your
women friends vouch for you?

539
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,799
I'm certain my current comfort
will satisfy the Inspector completely

540
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,349
as no doubt will your secretary.

541
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,193
When you've finished, will you bring
me some coffee into the library?

542
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,918
Certainly, sir.

543
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,395
Well, well. Jumpy, isn't he?

544
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,157
- You're very calm.
- I've no reason not to be.

545
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,319
I've just been thinking.

546
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,590
If that woman was foreign...

547
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,435
Think of girls more often -
it might bring about some changes.

548
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,750
- I know it's laughable.
- I agree.

549
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,357
No, but I mean if she was French,
it could be her I suppose.

550
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,953
I give up. Could be who?

551
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,355
- That Martine woman.
- Martine?

552
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,910
Yes, that French farm girl
we had all the trouble about.

553
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,839
The one
Edmund was so infatuated with.

554
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,109
That was ages ago.

555
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,514
Yes, I know.

556
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,550
Still, I suppose it is possible.

557
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,673
Why should she turn up
dead in our stable 16 years later?

558
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,236
- It's preposterous.
- It isn't my idea.

559
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,759
Whose idea is it then?

560
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,431
Well, Emma's.

561
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,278
Emma?

562
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,799
Emma's?

563
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,594
That's odd.

564
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,072
PauI!

565
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,189
- Darling...
- No, PauI, please!

566
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,433
How much longer will we go on like
this? We've got to tell the old man.

567
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,750
- Not yet. Please, not yet.
- Why? Why?

568
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,758
PauI, I think someone
in the family may be a murderer.

569
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,909
Emma!

570
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,074
I've had a letter.

571
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,630
I can't keep it to myself
any longer. I want you to read it.

572
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,435
I'm afraid
my French isn't up to this yet.

573
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,793
"Dear Miss Ackenthorpe, you will be
surprised to hear after so many years

574
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,793
that you have a sister-in-law.

575
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,316
I married Edmund two days
before he was killed in action.

576
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,238
I decided it was best to forget the
marriage, but I'm coming to England

577
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,709
and I find
I do wish to meet you all.

578
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,593
I write to you instead of your father
because I understand he is a sick man

579
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,396
and my existence may come as a shock
to him as it must be to you all.

580
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,348
Sincerely yours,
Martine Ackenthorpe."

581
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,033
I thought Edmund was killed
before they married.

582
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,636
- That's what we all thought.
- What's on your mind then?

583
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,310
Don't you see? The strangled woman,
it must have been Martine.

584
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,110
If she was really Edmund's widow,
she would have a share in the will.

585
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,548
Oh, I see.

586
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,352
PauI, what should I do?

587
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,151
- Have you told the others?
- No.

588
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,194
I did suggest to Albert that if she
was French, she might be Martine.

589
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,594
What did he say?

590
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,718
He said it was fantastic,
but I think he was worried.

591
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,989
- You have to tell the police.
- They'll think one of us did this.

592
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,391
- What else can you do?
- I don't know. I don't know.

593
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,558
I think you must tell them.

594
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,558
I'll have to think about this.

595
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,068
You'd better go.

596
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,510
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

597
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,757
- There you are.
- The train was late, Miss Marple.

598
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,434
Oh, good evening, Inspector.

599
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,596
I suppose you knew about
this compact business before I did?

600
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,749
Well...

601
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,356
I thought it best to bring
the Inspector in on this after all.

602
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,432
- Very wise. Very wise.
- I'm glad you think so.

603
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,438
Withholding information
is a very serious matter.

604
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,394
I know. I'm most awfully sorry.
Will you take tea?

605
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,874
Thank you, no.

606
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,189
Do you know what this means -
the compact being stolen from you?

607
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,349
Coffee perhaps?

608
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,189
The thief and the murderer are
almost certainly one and the same

609
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,598
and that he or she is in that house
and that your life may be in danger.

610
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,519
Oh, I say, do you really think so?

611
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,154
I must ask you
to give the whole thing up...

612
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,395
...tonight!

613
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,835
Indeed you must, Miss Marple.

614
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,318
Very well.
I'll give in my notice tomorrow.

615
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,358
Good. That's settled then.

616
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,715
It has to be
a month's notice, you know.

617
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,196
- Will you have a small beer?
- Miss Marple, I...

618
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,638
Oh, what's the use?

619
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,958
- Good night.
- Good night.

620
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,310
Well, now. How did you get on
at the probate registry?

621
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,637
Well, I think in view
of what the Inspector said...

622
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,030
- Did you see the will?
- Yes.

623
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,958
What did it say?

624
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,675
Old Mr Ackenthorpe's father obviously
didn't get on well with him.

625
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,394
I'm not surprised at that. Go on.

626
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,229
The house and the income
from the family fortune are his,

627
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,795
but he can't
touch the fortune itself.

628
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,479
- That's the first point.
- Yes?

629
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,354
The second point is that the fortune
goes to his children on his death,

630
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,590
to Emma, Cedric,
Harold and Albert.

631
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,037
Two of the others named in the will,
Edith and Edmund, are already dead.

632
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,474
Much more for the rest.

633
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,279
Young Alexander,
Edith's son, gets her share.

634
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,793
What about his father?

635
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,236
Next of kin only get a share
if there's no issue of a marriage.

636
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,437
Eastley's only interest
is how much Alexander gets.

637
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,876
- Dr Quimper to see you, sir.
- Oh, yes. Send him in.

638
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,078
Your call to the probate registry
has been usefuI.

639
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,511
- Morning.
- Morning. Sit down.

640
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,874
Thank you.

641
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,755
Have you found out
who the woman is yet?

642
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,275
The French police
haven't come up with anything.

643
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,040
You're assuming she's French?

644
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,152
The clothes and make-up
were made in Paris.

645
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,476
Is that what you wanted
to see me about?

646
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,715
No, sir.

647
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,919
I understand last Christmas, old Mr
Ackenthorpe had a stomach upset.

648
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,675
He's inclined to overindulge
when there's rich food about.

649
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,079
He said you asked questions as though
you suspected arsenic poisoning.

650
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,755
For a moment I did suspect
something was a bit odd.

651
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,951
- Didn't you run a food test?
- No.

652
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,879
- Why not?
- There was nothing positive.

653
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,031
No history of chronic gastric trouble

654
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,233
that one would expect to find in the
classic method of arsenic poisoning.

655
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,039
- You mean small regular doses?
- Exactly.

656
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,438
Excuse me.

657
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,629
Yes?

658
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,398
Oh, put her on.

659
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,036
- Miss Ackenthorpe.
- Emma?

660
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,309
Yes.

661
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,872
- Hello.
- Morning.

662
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,553
I have a letter from...

663
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,229
I see.

664
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,715
Well, would you
read the letter to me?

665
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,197
"Youu will be suurprised
to hear after so many years..."

666
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:09,073
Thank you. I'd like to send round for
that letter if you don't mind?

667
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,192
We'll check
with the French police. Thank you.

668
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,634
Goodbye.

669
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,149
- Do you know what that was about?
- Yes.

670
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,231
- I do.
- Why didn't you tell me?

671
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,991
I'm in love with Emma, Inspector.
I want to marry her.

672
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,515
I told her
she should tell you about this.

673
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,789
You didn't insist?

674
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,073
No, it was important to me, to us,
that she made up her own mind.

675
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,191
I understand, Doctor.

676
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,152
Thank you. Is that all?

677
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,476
Is the dead woman Martine?

678
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,949
- Who else could it be?
- Was she killed by a family member?

679
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,112
I'd rather not answer that.

680
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,589
All right.

681
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,279
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

682
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,749
Well, sir?

683
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,274
- I'm worried, Bacon.
- About the doctor?

684
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,839
No, no, not him.

685
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,437
I'm worried about Miss Marple.

686
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,350
- Looking for something, Miss Marple?
- No!

687
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,156
Are you... are you all right?

688
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,592
Yes, perfectly, thank you.

689
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,469
What is it you want?

690
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,474
I thought I'd take up the old boy's
night cap and save you the trouble.

691
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,074
That's kind of you. It is ready.

692
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,639
A storm, I expect.

693
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,395
The electricity supply is rather
shaky, like the rest of the place.

694
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,551
- You're a bit shaky too, aren't you?
- No, not at all.

695
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,670
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

696
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,030
Oh, my goodness! What are you doing?

697
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,800
- Looking for light.
- You ought to be asleep.

698
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,353
I happen to be reading.

699
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,788
Oh.

700
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,671
May I ask what you're doing?

701
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,115
Trying to provide light.

702
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,033
Oh, I see.
You won't find it there, you know.

703
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,111
- Indeed?
- It's a power failure.

704
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,475
Often happens. May I borrow this?

705
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,108
- Alexander, come back!
- Good night, Jane.

706
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,469
Who's that? Who is it?

707
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,992
Oh, Mr Cedric.

708
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,870
It's a power failure. Often happens.

709
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,396
- I'll have to find some candles.
- Just a minute.

710
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,791
My sister says you started
work here only a few days ago.

711
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,432
You don't look like a domestic.

712
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,757
I have to earn my living
like anybody else.

713
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,154
The day after you arrived,
the body was discovered.

714
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,514
- You found it.
- What makes you think that?

715
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,439
It fits and so neatly.

716
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,072
You telephoned the police.

717
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,198
I am not the person
who telephoned the police.

718
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,429
- You're not?
- No.

719
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,438
Who are you? What are you doing here?

720
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,238
I have already told you.

721
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:06,432
I'm going to watch you
very closely, Miss Marple... Jane.

722
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,718
Oh, Hillman.
I want to have a word with you.

723
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,479
Get out!

724
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,716
Oh... help!

725
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,319
What is it?

726
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,830
Albert. See to Albert...

727
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,952
Alexander, call the doctor. Quickly!

728
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,075
There was nothing I could do for him.

729
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,639
How are the others?

730
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,998
Emma, Cedric, Harold and Eastley have
had only minor effects.

731
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,038
The old man will be all right.
He's a tough old bird.

732
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,952
They will recover by morning.

733
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,031
- No doubt about the cause?
- No.

734
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,429
- They were all poisoned.
- Well... thank you, Doctor.

735
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,670
Quimper! Quimper!

736
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,071
Harold - I might have expected him
to bellow the hardest.

737
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,630
This is the last chicken stock.

738
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,033
- Finished?
- Just about.

739
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,954
See that stuff gets to the lab.
That's it for tonight.

740
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,149
Well?

741
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,199
Mushroom soup, curried duck and rice
and apple pie.

742
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,479
Thank you.

743
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,632
- Mushroom soup out of a can?
- Certainly not.

744
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,310
Half a pound of mushrooms,
chicken stock, milk, flour,

745
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,550
lemon juice, a touch of herbs...

746
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,716
Hmm. Mushrooms?

747
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,673
I had some of the soup myself -
superb!

748
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,792
Oh, I'm sure! The pie?

749
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,549
I'm afraid I never can resist
my own pie, Inspector.

750
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,278
Anybody else's, of course.

751
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,434
- The curry?
- Exactly.

752
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,797
Good, of course,
but rice you see... fattening...

753
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,991
and as I was having the pie...

754
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,998
Where did the duck come from?

755
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,310
Oh, those... Mr Harold shot them.

756
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,040
He seems to be rather fond
of killing things.

757
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,837
Alexander doesn't seem
to have had any curry either?

758
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,709
No. I thought it would appeal to him.
Curious child.

759
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,235
Well, did anyone enter the kitchen
while the cooking was going on?

760
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,029
Not while I was there.
I do have other duties, you know.

761
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,193
Anyone could have come in.

762
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,952
Six people are poisoned...
only one dies.

763
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,954
I'm thinking about that too,
Inspector.

764
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,670
Message from the Chief Constable.

765
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,308
- He's waiting for your report.
- All right.

766
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,115
- In person, sir.
- Get the car, I'll be a minute.

767
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,389
Very good.

768
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,198
I think the two killings
are connected, don't you?

769
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,634
Yes, I do.

770
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,792
We've got to find out
who has that compact.

771
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,474
I've only been able to search
one room.

772
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:13,474
- Oh, whose?
- Unfortunately, Albert's.

773
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,669
Oh!

774
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,558
- Miss Marple, I have to go.
- Oh, yes, I know.

775
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,155
A policeman's work is never done.

776
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,079
Nor a woman's.

777
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,594
I was going to say,
please be carefuI.

778
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,436
If you think of anything,
do take me into your confidence.

779
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,470
The lab boys turned it up
as arsenic in the curry.

780
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,918
Not a lot, just enough for
stomach aches. Not enough to kill.

781
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:16,389
- So Albert had an extra dose?
- Why poison the others at all?

782
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,309
If the poisoner is a member of
the family, he had to be ill as well.

783
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,393
Well, say it isn't, sir.

784
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,074
I mean that gardener of theirs -
Hillman.

785
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,310
Locals say he's in for a nice bequest
when old Ackenthorpe goes.

786
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,276
- It is a possibility.
- You're forgetting the dead woman.

787
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,477
This poisoning means
she was Martine Ackenthorpe.

788
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,752
Have the French police
come up with something then?

789
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,150
Only that there's no record
of a marriage.

790
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,676
The village where Ackenthorpe
was stationed was blown to bits.

791
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,831
- All files were destroyed.
- Well?

792
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,634
Don't you see,
it's the pattern of the killings.

793
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,360
Only a family member
would want her dead too.

794
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:57,513
Yes, kill off all your relations in
easy stages except the old man.

795
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,389
When he dies naturally,
inherit the fortune and the property.

796
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,553
Albert must have got his second dose
after dinner, possibly in a drink.

797
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,355
Don't drink that.

798
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,113
- Why not?
- Because it's lunch time.

799
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,111
Oh! What is it?

800
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,236
Beef broth and baked custard.

801
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,234
- Beef broth? I ordered beefsteak.
- The doctor said beef broth.

802
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,755
To blazes with him!
I give the orders.

803
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,956
I'm sick of slops. Take it away!

804
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,314
Certainly.

805
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,470
Hillman, another bottle.

806
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,353
Surely you know
that if the woman was Martine,

807
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,990
by giving the letter to the police
the finger points at one of us.

808
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,355
Not only for her death,
but Albert's too.

809
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,478
- Exactly. One of us.
- I expected that from you!

810
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,433
Oh, come now,
you're thinking exactly as I am.

811
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,791
If you didn't do it...
you're thinking it was me.

812
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,479
Stop it! Stop it!

813
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,398
Or even you, dear Emma.

814
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,273
I think we've had enough
of this nonsense.

815
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,271
I bet the police don't think so.

816
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,352
Say what you like,
but please leave Emma out of it.

817
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,198
Well, it could be argued
that Emma kept that letter to herself

818
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,316
to use it to her own advantage.

819
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,239
You'd better explain that.

820
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,591
Well, the moment Martine's body
was discovered

821
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,878
everyone in this family was under
suspicion, including you, Emma.

822
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,270
The moment you produced the letter,

823
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,477
everyone was under suspicion...
excluding you.

824
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:51,155
- I hadn't thought of it like that.
- You must be round the bend.

825
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:55,074
The woman was strangled. Do you think
your sister capable of that?

826
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,193
Oh, but Emma's an attractive woman,
don't you think so?

827
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,713
Well?

828
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,758
A pretty lady doesn't need to do
her own dirty work.

829
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,599
Emma, let's leave them to it.

830
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,997
Now, now, Eastley. Emma has her eye
on the doctor, you know.

831
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,397
It won't be so easy for you to marry
into the family again.

832
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,677
Oh, that hit home, didn't it?

833
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,156
Yes and I'm about ready
to break your blasted neck.

834
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,471
Very possibly,
but tell me something first.

835
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,553
Did you meet Emma secretly the night
before the body was found?

836
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,671
- Well, I...
- Hillman saw you.

837
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,878
We did meet that night, yes.

838
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,990
- He asked me to mediate with Father.
- Oh, what for?

839
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,350
I wanted to borrow money.

840
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,439
Oh, my goodness!

841
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,234
What are you doing?

842
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,872
- Making up the bed.
- You made it up this morning.

843
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,713
Yes but the pillowslips
need changing.

844
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,677
They look all right to me.

845
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,673
But not to me.
Oh, what am I doing?

846
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,470
I do wish that woman would hurry up.

847
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,631
They know I don't like the dark.

848
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,075
Are you afraid
some man will get you?

849
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,710
It's funny how things
come together.

850
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,714
My sister's eldest had measles
and then her Ernie broke his arm

851
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,509
and her husband came out all over
with boils, all in the same week.

852
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:24,468
You wouldn't believe it, would you?
It will be the same thing here.

853
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,474
First that nasty murder,
then Mr Albert poisoned.

854
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,358
Who's going to be next?

855
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,872
Things always go in threes.

856
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,634
Here you are.

857
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,917
Sorry to keep you, but the doctor was
with Mr Ackenthorpe.

858
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,832
Hmm! Long wait for very little.

859
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,909
The younger generation.
Well, I don't know!

860
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,399
What's the matter?

861
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,589
It's Mr Harold.

862
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,798
Did he use it or did somebody else
pull the trigger?

863
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,518
It adds up if it was suicide.

864
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,836
Harold killed the other two,
got cold feet

865
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,355
and took the easy way out.

866
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,637
They all knew he liked shooting
before dinner at the Hall.

867
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,717
He was shot from a two-inch range.

868
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,839
All right.

869
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,198
Someone he knows casually
asks him for the gun and...

870
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,638
It could still be suicide.

871
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,268
That's what the murderer
wants us to think.

872
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,719
We can't risk any more killings.
Come on.

873
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,472
- Where to, sir?
- The Hall.

874
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,590
I'll find the compact even if I have
to turn the place upside down.

875
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,516
Excuse me, sir,
there's a Miss Marple to see you.

876
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:34,195
- Come in. Good afternoon.
- You were going somewhere?

877
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,669
- Yes.
- I'll come to the point at once.

878
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,676
BeautifuI little piece, isn't it?

879
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,158
- Who had it?
- Alexander.

880
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,752
I should have realised.
That boy's incorrigible.

881
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,789
Playing it at midnight like that.
Typical.

882
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,673
- So we're back where we began?
- No, Inspector.

883
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,440
I think I know who our murderer is.

884
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,552
The difficulty is getting him
to show his hand.

885
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,070
- Sit down, Miss Marple.
- Thank you.

886
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,194
Hold that expression.

887
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,919
Oh, pity, you spoilt it.

888
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,513
What's the matter?
Things not working out for you?

889
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:39,116
You make everything you say
sound like an insinuation.

890
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,315
He works at it.

891
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,471
Do stop fussing, Quimper.

892
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,676
If I wish to come down,
I shall do so.

893
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,358
I think this chair, Hillman.

894
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,636
- Father, don't you...
- Don't start!

895
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,109
Sorry, Emma,
but once his mind is made up...

896
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,595
I'm not going to stay up there
all alone.

897
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:58,994
Might get murdered in my bed.
At least there's safety in numbers.

898
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,317
- I quite agree with you.
- That makes a nice change.

899
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,153
I want a drink.
No, not you... Quimper.

900
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,719
Then I must leave.

901
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,235
Don't smother me with it,
put it over my knees!

902
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,876
This is all very cosy.
How about a rubber of bridge?

903
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,394
Just a thought!

904
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,558
What have you got there, boy?

905
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,233
A charming little thing.

906
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,960
French, second empire.
Valuable, I'd say.

907
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:34,989
Where did you get it?

908
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,713
It belongs to Miss Marple.

909
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,473
- You had better give it back.
- I only borrowed it.

910
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,437
I'll drop it in on my way to bed.

911
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,790
- Come in, Doctor.
- You were expecting me?

912
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,393
- Didn't Alexander tell you?
- Tell me what?

913
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,718
ForgetfuI boy.

914
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,598
I have a sore throat

915
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,718
and asked him to ask you
to look at it before you left.

916
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,474
I see.

917
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:02,112
I haven't had one of these throats
in years.

918
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,795
Well you've been lucky, Miss Marple.
Any headaches?

919
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,473
No, just the sore throat.

920
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,398
Well, we'll have a look.

921
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,075
This is attractive.

922
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,990
- Yes, isn't it?
- Where did you get it?

923
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,549
- I found it.
- Oh, where?

924
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,792
- In the stables here.
- Really?

925
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:25,914
Open wide, please.

926
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,878
- Say, "Ahh".
- Ahh.

927
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,639
No inflammation.

928
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,195
Don't you think that was dishonest,
keeping the compact?

929
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,233
Under the circumstances, Doctor, no.

930
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,114
- Is there any swelling?
- I don't think so.

931
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,838
I've seen you like that once before,
your hands at a woman's throat.

932
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,958
It was on a train
and you were strangling her.

933
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,956
- That's quite an allegation.
- I have a few more.

934
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:12,749
Oh?

935
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,757
You want the compact because
you had given it to that woman

936
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,713
and it might be traced back to you.

937
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,871
- I think she was your wife.
- Do you?

938
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:28,594
You killed her after you had written
that letter to Emma.

939
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:33,117
- You signed it Martine Ackenthorpe.
- Why should I do that?

940
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,869
The murder - so that you would then
be free to marry Emma.

941
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,999
The letter - so that people would
think the dead woman was Martine

942
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,515
and look among the family
for the killer...

943
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,278
...never at you.

944
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,752
How did you arrive
at this fascinating hypothesis?

945
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,717
It was I who found her body.

946
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,913
Martine was, or is, for all I know,
a Normandy peasant.

947
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,349
The dead woman
had never worked on a farm.

948
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,314
I saw her hands.

949
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,718
- Go on.
- Certainly.

950
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,354
You proceeded to augment
your prospects...

951
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,192
...by eliminating Albert and Harold.

952
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,554
How, conceivably?

953
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,276
You contrived to introduce arsenic
into my curry,

954
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,795
which I find unforgivable,

955
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,389
knowing that you would be asked
to deal with the after-effects.

956
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,348
Easy then to give Albert
his final dose in the medicine.

957
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,589
And Harold?

958
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:43,832
You shot him
and made it look like suicide.

959
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,991
Ingenious, I must admit.

960
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,633
More than that.

961
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,432
Now you are here to secure
your wife's compact...

962
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,312
...a fair case.

963
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:59,793
Yes, a pity you won't be able
to present it.

964
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:04,433
One more murder, Doctor,
might be one too many.

965
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,108
This won't look like murder,
Miss Marple.

966
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:11,319
The death certificate signed by me
will register heart failure.

967
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,432
- All right?
- Yes, thank you.

968
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,951
You're under arrest. I warn you...

969
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:23,271
That everything was recorded
and will be used in evidence.

970
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,275
You were right about everything.

971
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,157
You're a very brave woman,
Miss Marple. Good night.

972
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,154
Oh!

973
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,473
About time too!

974
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,280
I was coming up to see you
before leaving.

975
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,998
No need to leave.

976
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,718
I have my own home.

977
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,316
- Sell it!
- Why on earth should I?

978
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,312
Well...
taking one thing and another...

979
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,270
...I mean, you're a fair cook

980
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:38,678
and... er... you seem to have
your wits about you and...

981
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,517
Well, I've decided to marry you.

982
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,838
- Well?
- Well, I'm honoured, of course.

983
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,632
Yes, but come to the point.

984
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,995
- I'm afraid that cannot be.
- Why?

985
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:58,716
Well if I ever do embark on such
a venture, there is someone else.

986
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,917
Nonsense! I don't believe it.
Who would have you?

987
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,919
Apparently you for one,
Mr Ackenthorpe.

988
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:08,834
Goodbye.

989
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,070
The woman is completely unbalanced!

990
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:26,995
- Oh, Miss Marple, I am so glad...
- How good of you to come.

991
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,878
- Let me help.
- Thank you.
